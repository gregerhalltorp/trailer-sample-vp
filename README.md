# Back-end work sample brief

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn`

## Running

### Dev cycle

`tmdbApiKey=<Your key here> yarn dev`

### "Prod"

1. yarn build
2. `tmdbApiKey=<Your key here> node build/index.js`

## TODOS:

- Handle other sites than YouTube (tmdb supports videos from Vimeo and maybe more)
  _Excluded due to time constraints, would require a lot of analysis_
